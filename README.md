## AutoSwappr
Autoswappr is a modern web application built using Next.js, a powerful React-based framework for creating server-side rendered and static websites. This project was bootstrapped with `create-next-app`, making it easy to get started with a pre-configured setup.

## Getting Started

To set up and run the project locally, follow these steps:

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- NodeJS: Download and install the latest version from NodeJS official site.
- Package Manager: You can use one of the following package managers:
    - `pnpm`: Install via npm with `npm install -g pnpm`.

> **Warning**: This project uses `pnpm` as the package manager. Please do not use `npm` or `yarn` as they may cause dependency issues. If you don't have pnpm installed, you can install it via `npm install -g pnpm`.

## Installation

- Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repository/autoswappr.git

cd autoswappr
```

- Install dependencies:
```bash
pnpm install
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the app.

## Live Reloading
You can start editing the app by modifying the main file located at: `app/page.tsx`

Changes you make will automatically refresh the browser, so you can see updates in real-time.
